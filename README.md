Exercice de montée en compétences DTY Spring 2019


# Choices of technologies
This web app will be developped using HTML5 and CSS3. The corresponding stack is the MEAN stack.

The frameworks chosen are respectively Angular JS and Bootstrap CSS for the front client.
For the back, I used Node.JS, as well as Express.JS and Mongoose with MongoDB for the database. The authentication is handled throught Passport.JS and a local strategy defined with mongoose, that protects the endpoints of the API.
